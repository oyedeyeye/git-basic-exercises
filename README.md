I am basically learning about UNIX and the Command Line Interface (CLI).
I would like to thank UMUZI and TQStem for this great opportunity.


Hey there! I started my web development journey in 2019, but i got burned out.

I needed a lot of rest to recuperate, then corona virus took the stage.

My PC machine was at this time hell.

More of my stories to come on later.


I will log this out to through the other branches.
